# 👋 Kazuhiro Watanabe - Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [React](https://react.dev/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).  
It serves as a showcase of my experience as a Backend Engineer and is mainly used for job applications and networking.
